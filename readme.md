Developing a REST API with PHP and MySQL.

## The Challenge

Given the instructions, I was required to analyze, create and test a RESTful API for an e-commerce company to manage their items.


### A. Explain the structure of your code

It's organized by simple folders:

* class: Where the Item class is stored;
* config: Where the Database file is located;
* items: The action files are stored;

### B. Any libraries

The test uses pure PHP and MySQL, so nothing else is required.

### C. Installation and testing steps

* Create the database using the database.sql file;
* Check the configuration access in config/Database.php, change the credentials to match yours;
* Access the url files from items folder in Postman using the desired payload;


### D. Any additional stuff you added

I found important to have the modified date of this entry, so we could use it to gain more information about which item is selling the most and which is not.


### E. Thoughts on what you would have liked to add if you had the time

Certanly more comments and double check the indentation;

### F. Any additional comments you have

It was very fun doing it, I hope this is a good outcome, I had little time to finish it (had some major PC problems lately), but I guess it can show that I'm aware of how a RESTful API works.

Thank you!
